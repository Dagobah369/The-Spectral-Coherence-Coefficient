Abstract

We establish an exact identity for the spectral coherence measure computed on
stationary unfolded gap sequences: for any N ≥ 2, E[CN] = (N − 1)/N. Under
short-range mixing assumptions, we further show that Var(CN) ∼ c/N2, where the
constant c depends solely on the symmetry class (GOE/GUE/GSE). Applied to the
non-trivial zeros of ζ(s), the framework predicts and explains the value C10 = 0.9:
N = 10 is the unique window length aligning the natural window shift contraction
(N − 1)/N with the mean E[CN]. An AR(1) modeling with negative rank-1 correlation
(ϕ ≈ −0.36) accounts for the observed dispersion and the N − 2 regime.
Numerically, we validate these results on the first 10^5 zeros and describe a reproducible
streaming pipeline extensible to 10^10 zeros (simple/refined unfolding, block
bootstrap, ACF). The formalism extends to L-function families: the mean remains
universal, while the variance encodes the class. We position 0.9 as a universal spectral
invariant—a key to analytic stability—without claiming to prove the Riemann
Hypothesis, but providing proven statements on means and falsifiable predictions
on dispersions.
